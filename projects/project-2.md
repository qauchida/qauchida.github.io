summary: A responsive web visualization to convey Hawaii HIV/AIDs survey data.
--- 
In the Fall of 2018, I participated in a Data Visualization course (ICS 484) and the final project involved analyzing and visualizing a data set of our own choosing. On this project, I worked with 3 other people, one of whom was a graduate student in the Public Health program and the other 2 were ICS majors. However, this class required knowledge of JavaScript, which I had no experience in. But I had begged the instructor for an override, due to his plans to no longer offer this class. Given that I struggled with the first project in the class, the progress I made throughout the semester was astronomical. 

The most difficult aspect of this project was the challenge of working on a website with the different individuals with which the group comprised of. In my INBRE research project, which was mentioned previously, I did the majority of the work alone. On the other hand, this project required me to work with other programmers as well as an individual with no computer science experience. Essentially, our group worked to translate the ideas of the graduate student into a visualization that was compliant with the concepts taught in the class. We required constant communication, due in part to the need for consistency when arranging color schemes, layout and font details that we often overlooked. 

For this project, I was personally in charge of creating interactive data visualizations that conveyed data concerning respondents of the survey, their needs, and the socio-economic breakdown of the responses. I created 15 of these charts which can be viewed by clicking on specific bars on the chart entitled "Access to Services by Difficulty." Of the 15 charts, 2 (Dental Care and Alternative Therapy) have multiple charts associated with them that are accessible by the buttons above the smaller charts.

Moreover, this project taught me the importance of tailoring effective communication to the needs of the individuals. Our professor highly encouraged the class to sketch out drafts of visualizations before we even touched a keyboard. Like many students, our group ignored him at first until we realized that many of the problems we encountered in the beginning, stemmed from inaccurate descriptions of what each person was thinking. The drawings helped us embody an abstract idea, while also being an effective tool for communication of our individual thought processes. 

Like many students before us, our group also had trouble with the ambiguity of text-only communication. We finally found that the good old-fashioned meeting helped us utilize our time more effectively. The members of our group often had a difficult time composing text to accompany our visualizations but having an in-person discussion helped us to flesh out our ideas. All of these learning experiences throughout this project helped me personally grow as a team player.
