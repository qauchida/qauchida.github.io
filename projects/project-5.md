## A Blank Canvas
In the summer of 2020, I participated in an undergraduate research experience at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. As part of the experience, [Angeli Amascual](https://angeli-amascual.github.io/) , [Max Deyo](https://maxdeyo.github.io/), [Hanna Park](https://hannaparkuh.github.io/) and I worked on designing an application to engage Hawaii high school students in Computer Science education. We assumed that a mobile application would appeal to high school students and therefore began making mobile prototypes.

Initially, we designed individual wireframe mockups using Figma. Below, there are a few different prototypes I created, which eventually manifested in one of the current iterations.
I wonâ€™t go into too much detail, but each prototype attempts to appeal to a student not currently interested in Computer Science.
