## A Blank Canvas
In the summer of 2020, I participated in an undergraduate research experience at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. As part of the experience, [Angeli Amascual](https://angeli-amascual.github.io/) , [Max Deyo](https://maxdeyo.github.io/), [Hanna Park](https://hannaparkuh.github.io/) and I worked on designing an application to engage Hawaii high school students in Computer Science education. We assumed that a mobile application would appeal to high school students and therefore began making mobile prototypes.

Initially, we designed individual wireframe mockups using Figma. Below, there are a few different prototypes I created, which eventually manifested in one of the current iterations.
I wonâ€™t go into too much detail, but each prototype attempts to appeal to a student not currently interested in Computer Science.

## 2 Roads Diverged 
After the group presented various prototypes, we began making individual apps using Expo, React Native and JavaScript/TypeScript. During this time, I practiced using the Expo and React Native toolchain. I mainly used functional components for this version of the app while using the
```useState()``` [Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html), rather than making class based components and having to call a constructor for props and state. 

[You can find the repo of this prototype here](https://github.com/radgrad/CSExplore-Quinne). After viewing work done by my other group members, it seemed Angeli and I had similar design principles. We used a lot of graphics rather than text, attempted to reflect Hawaiian themes in the user interface design and made the prototypes similar to role playing games. Going forward, we attempted to combine our designs into one application while Max and Hanna teamed up to produce theirs.
