According to the Stack overflow developer survey of 2018 (insert link https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#demographics), only 6.9% of participants responded as women. To me, as a female, those numbers are absolutely terrifying because it makes me, and many other women, feel alone. The goal of this project is to remind women in Computer Science at UH Manoa that they, in fact, are never alone. Being a female in any form of science or engineering is harrowing as these fields have been traditionally male dominated and are also academically demanding. By showing other women in this field prominent female figures in the past, present and possible future, this project hopes to inspire others and provide moral support to those in this intense field of study.

This essay https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/06/25/lecturers-explanation-gender-gap-computer-science-it-reflect-womens-choices is a thought provoking piece on the insights of the gender gap in technology related fields. However, just because it is plausible that MOST women may not be interested in Computer Science, it is our mission to support the few that are. Listed below are various prominent women in Computer Science from the past, present and near future:

-  Mary Kenneth Keller was the first woman to receive a pHD in Computer Science, all the way back in 1965 from the University of Wisconsin.
- Grace Hopper 
- Katherine Johnson
- Margaret Hamilton

Your Female Faculty Members:
- Martha Crosby
- Susana Stills
- Kyungmin Baek
- Guilayne Poison

Your Female Graduate Students:
- LiChien
- Katrina Johnson-Turner
- Lisa Miller


What if Iâ€™m not a woman, but still support them?

Anyone, regardless of gender, can pledge their support for women in Computer Science. To show your support, create a profile, preferably with a picture and accept the terms and conditions. You will receive updates of events or milestones of women in Computer Science as well as be potentially added to a mosaic set on the homepage of all supporters of women in Computer Science. There may even be stickers in the works for registered members.
