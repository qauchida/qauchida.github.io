The culmination of my experience with Semantic UI can be summed into a single sentence: user interface frameworks are just HTML in drag. For those of you sorely in need of a pop culture update, drag is the art of transforming from the ordinary into your wildest fantasy and user interface frameworks allow web designers to transform the drab into something fab. I am making this comparison not only to highlight that I love RuPaul’s Drag Race, but also because it is a succinct definition of web based user interfaces. 


## Great drag queens and great web designers have a multitude of traits in common. 
- In any given group, there is always a diva. 
- A great look will give the artist a sense of pride and accomplishment.
- Their full designs are cohesive, as each part works together to support the whole.
- They express their individuality.
- They go big or go home.
- They don’t take themselves too seriously.
- Their best work comes out when it is clear they are having fun.


Whether it be Bootstrap or Semantic UI, everyone has their own drag fantasy and we as website designers should be unabashed in our efforts of self-expression. Let your inner queen shine and in the immortal words of RuPaul Charles, “You better work.”
