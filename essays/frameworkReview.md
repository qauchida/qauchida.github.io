To this day I’ve only used React to make web apps. I have limited brainspace so I’d rather just stick with what I know about React (which isn’t much). But technology is always changing so maybe there’s something new out there worth learning that can replace React.

First, here’s a quick run down of React.

## React

It’s called React because it’s reactive, meaning the appearance of the page will change without manually refreshing it. Think of this like a mantra and repeat it before you go to bed every night, “Change in props to change state to trigger rerender.” 

Another key thing about React is that it’s component based, which can make it easier if you need to reuse components. 

To make a React App, you need to install Node.js and npm, both of which are free. 

Currently RadGrad2 uses React, Meteor, MongoDB and Typescript so I will most likely be looking at if NativeScript or Flutter is compatible with Meteor and MongoDB. 


## NativeScript
This framework can actually use React.

## Flutter
