Due to the current circumstances of the world right now caused by covid-19, people have been forced to find new ways to work together while still maintaining physical distance.
Computer programmers are stereotyped to be reclusive and to avoid human contact but the reality is that in person collboration is essential when trying to create a group project. This summer, I am participating in a research team and we experimented with remote pair programming.

## Geting Started
I first started trying to set up [floobits](floobits.com) by following the instructions listed on their website. Installing the plugin was easy but I made the mistake of attempting to have both the web editor and intelliJ open at the same time. Then, I closed both and attempted to run Floobits on my intelliJ again. I got a message saying:  "the following remote file is different from your version:  static/.nojekyll."
I wasn't able to open that file in IntelliJ and decided to overwrite the remote version of static/.nojekyll.

I found that if you use the web editor, you can video chat at the same time, without having to open another program up. It doesn't look like you can do the same thing using the intelliJ plugin so if I wanted to video or voice chat, I would have to open up another program. 
Although the web editor has built in video chat capabilities, it doesn't have any of the convieneces of the intelliJ features I use the most like the vim emulator or the "shift shift" search shortcut.

## Session 1: Up and Running

In this session, I worked with [Angeli Amascual](https://angeli-amascual.github.io/) from 12:00 to 12:30 on 05/29/2020. Before we jumped right into using it, we talked for a bit about how this was going to work. We used Zoom at the same time as floobits so we could screen share our locally rendered version of radgrad.github.io and talk through our code. First, I invited Angeli to my workspace and talked through what I was doing while showing her my code. Then, she invited me to her workspace and did the same. I had trouble connecting to her workspace through the IntelliJ plugin so I had to settle on using the web editor. After we ended our Zoom call, I was able to join her workspace and use the IntelliJ plugin. 

30 minutes felt super short. We used most of our time just trying to get the hang of using Floobits and we didn't try to make changes to our code during this session. 

## Session 2: Trying to Break It

In this session, our research group wanted to see what happens when all 4 of us try to work at the same time. Angeli, [Max Deyo](https://maxdeyo.github.io/), [Hanna Park](http://hannaparkuh.github.io/) and I all tried to work on the same thing on 05/30/2020 around 1:30pm.
