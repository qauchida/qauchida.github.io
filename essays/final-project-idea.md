## For the Support of Women In Computer Science At UH Manoa
[According to the Stack overflow developer survey of 2018](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#demographics), only 6.9% of participants responded as women. To me, as a female, those numbers are absolutely terrifying because it makes me, and many other women, feel alone. The goal of this project is to remind women in Computer Science at UH Manoa that they, in fact, are never alone. Being a female in any form of science or engineering is harrowing as these fields have been traditionally male dominated and are also academically demanding. By showing other women in this field prominent female figures of the past, present and possible future, this project hopes to inspire others and provide moral support to those in this intense field of study.

[This essay](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/06/25/lecturers-explanation-gender-gap-computer-science-it-reflect-womens-choices) is a thought provoking piece on the insights of the gender gap in technology related fields. However, just because it is plausible that MOST women may not be interested in Computer Science, it is our mission to support those that are. Listed below are various prominent women in Computer Science from the past, present and near future:

-  Mary Kenneth Keller was the first woman to receive a pHD in Computer Science, all the way back in 1965 from the University of Wisconsin.
- Grace Hopper was a pioneering programmer for the United States Navy.
- Katherine Johnson is credited with coining the term 'software engineering'.
- Margaret Hamilton was a 'human computer' at NASA. 
- Dr. Talia Gershon is the current senior manager of AI Challenges and Quantum Computing at IBM.

Your Female Faculty Members:
- Martha Crosby
- Susanne Stills
- Kyungmin Baek
- Guylaine Poison
- Kim Binstead


Your Female Graduate Students:
- Ling-Chih
- Katrina Johnson-Turner
- Lisa Miller


What if Iâ€™m not a woman, but still support them?

Anyone, regardless of gender, can pledge their support for women in Computer Science. To show your support, create a profile, preferably with a picture and accept the terms and conditions. You will receive updates of events or milestones of women in Computer Science as well as be potentially added to a mosaic set on the homepage of all supporters of women in Computer Science. There may even be stickers in the works for registered members. 


## Overview
The problem: The female to male ratio of ICS students and faculty at UH is low and, as a result, may create a discouraging environment for current and potential female ICS students/faculty members. 
The solution: This application creates the startings of a support community for female ICS students and faculty members at UH by facilitating communication amongst them. 



## Mockup Page Ideas
- Landing Page
- User Homepage
- Admin/Moderators Homepage
- Historical Women in Computer Science
- UH Manoa Female Faculty and Grad Students Display Page
- Possible page for female led publications and events
- Links to scholarships aimed for female ICS students 
- Recommendations/links to internships
- Inspiration Page (collection videos, articles, other media)
- About the Developers 

## Use Case Ideas
- New user sets up a profile from landing, logs in, writes tweet style supportive message for females in Computer Science to finish setting up their profile, goes to user home
- Admin logs in to landing, goes to admin home, makes edits to site
- Returning user logs in to landing, goes to user home, goes to possible messaging system

## Beyond the Basics 
- app messaging capabilities between female members 
- Cool promotional video with interview footage of UH female CS faculty/students
- graphical representation of all registered users with supportive messages
- ratings of internships
- notification system for new scholarships, internships, events, etc.
