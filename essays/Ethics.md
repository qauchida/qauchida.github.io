Why do programmers marry young? Because they're quick to commit. Get it? Its a (great) github joke. 
With most of my writings, I highlight my pieces with jokes and sarcasm because that reflects of who I am. It also makes my writing a pure enjoyment, which translates to my readers. However, today I need to forgo the quips and snide remarks in order to discuss ethics. It is my hope that you, the reader, will understand the reason why I am choosing a more serious tone is because it is in fact, an extremely serious topic. Jokes have no place in this discussion. I and many others have used the excuse of "I'm just a student" without realizing that by saying as such, we deflect any ounce of responsibility that would be placed on our shoulders. It is imperative that everyone, whether they be students or professionals, acknowledges the power they hold in the palm of their hand.

In Computer Science there is a professional code of ethics known as the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. But not every ethical dilemma can be solved by referencing a professional code and there will be times when as a programmer, you must make a decision based on your personal ethics. [In this heart breaking testimonial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e), the author, Bill Sourour, details an decision he made which resulted in the suicide of a young woman. 

While the death was not an explicit result of Sourour's actions, there were opportunities for him to call out the project as unethical. In his case, he could have reffered to the ACM Code of Ethics, specifically 3.7, to "recognize and take special care of systems that have become integrated into the infastructure of society." The description of this ethic states, "When organizations and groups develop systems that become an important part of the infrastructure of society, their leaders have an added responsibility to be good stewards of these systems." But Sourour's dilemma is figuring out if being a good steward means following the client's orders or if it means listening to his conscience. 

In Sourour's case, his decision was made based on his personal ethics.

## Personal ethics are how we act when no one is watching.

They cannot be regulated by any organization and the only person who can hold you accountable is yourself.
