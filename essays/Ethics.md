Why do programmers marry young? Because they're quick to commit. Get it? Its a (great) github joke. 
With most of my writings, I highlight my pieces with jokes and sarcasm because that reflects of who I am. It also makes my writing a pure enjoyment, which translates to my readers. However, today I need to forgo the quips and snide remarks in order to discuss ethics. It is my hope that you, the reader, will understand the reason why I am choosing a more serious tone is because it is in fact, an extremely serious topic. Jokes have no place in this discussion.
