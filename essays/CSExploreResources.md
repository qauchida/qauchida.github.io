The simplest solution would be to advertise Code.org, Tableau Data Kids and the Hack club as  opportunities in CSExplore similar to how RadGrad does and then reward students for their participation. This way, CSExplore can act as a hub for computer science activities in Hawaii, tailored to students before college. 

Similarly to RadGrad, we can use CSExplore to show the possibilities in computer science using the UMass Careers Page and Code.org’s videos. It looks like UMass has virtual events but I’m not sure if that is only because of the current situation with social distancing. If they regularly hold virtual events, it could be used as an event for students to attend so they can see the possibilities of an education in computer science.

We can use it to generate exposure and education for those who otherwise may not have the resources for a traditional computer science education.

The downside to these systems is that none of them are specific to Hawaii. If the design of CSExplore is tailored to students in Hawaii, we can help with the advancement of computer science education within our community first. Additionally, if CSExplore can be integrated with RadGrad, it can provide a smooth transition for students from Hawaii who wish to continue their education at UH Manoa. 

Here is an idea of how CSExplore can pipeline into the DOE’s requirements for honor graduates in Hawaii public schools: provide a senior project framework for high school students. Senior projects are required for Hawaii high schoolers (in public schools) to graduate with honors, regardless of GPA (meaning that  even if you had a 4.0, if you did not complete a senior project, you would not be able to receive any title). CSExplore can advertise a special “Senior Project” section. In it, we could put together opportunities students could use for their senior project, and provide materials (like curriculum for building a web app) and perhaps even consultations with college students and professionals. 



Below, I have a more in depth discussion about the resources.


## Code.org
Code.org offers excellent free materials to teach computer science courses tailored for students at all education levels. What’s wonderful about this organization is that it makes computer science education accessible to all, regardless of income. It has materials meant to inspire students, such as videos from celebrities and former President Obama, and it even has a speaker program that allows students to hear from professionals in the field of computing and technology. 

Code.org has a useful report on the state of Hawaii’s computer science education and projections for the future.
[Here's a report they did on Hawaii.](https://code.org/advocacy/state-facts/HI.pdf)
According to their report, 33% of Hawaii high schools use Code.org’s curriculum along with 33% of middle schools and 44% of elementary schools. 

The main disadvantage of the Code.org system is that it relies on voluntary participation from teachers in these schools, most of whom are already overworked and underpaid.

[Here's a report on Hawaii public schools and Computer Science Education.](http://www.hawaiipublicschools.org/TeachingAndLearning/StudentLearning/CSforHI/Pages/default.aspx)
CSExplore could use the Code.org resources to help establish the program at schools that currently do not have them. For example, a lot of high schools in Hawaii participate in FIRST robotics competition. 

Personally, I have fond memories of competing and it was through robotics that I became exposed to STEM education as a possibility (even though I was a builder and worked mainly in the shop). By teaming up with robotics teams and coordinators, we may be able to establish good relationships with schools that already have support for STEM education but may just need a little help. We can then provide after school Code.org workshops for students and ECS training for teachers. If we want to really impact the students, we have to set the teachers up, because they can continue to inspire these students even when we’re gone. 

 After we help establish schools with an interest, we can then focus on schools that struggle with STEM education. Those schools may be the hardest to reach, but if we already have established relationships with other schools, it could help us in those harder to reach areas.



## ECS
Exploring Computer Science provides high school level computer science curriculum and teacher training. It is similar to Code.org’s programs and it appears that these resources are free but there is no confirmation of the cost. ECS’s one year program consists of 6 units, with each unit requiring about 6 weeks to complete.

I’m not sure that this could be helpful to CSExplore because it doesn’t look like schools in Hawaii use this resource. [According to this graphic found on their site, ](http://www.exploringcs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ECS-Map-Aug-2019.png) they do not have a hub in Hawaii and from the report mentioned earlier, the DOE relies on Code.org’s program in their schools. 

We could be optimistic and try to establish ECS programs here, but it would be prudent to try to work with established programs first. 


## UMass CS Careers Page
The UMass Careers Page provides statistical insight on the University of Massachusetts alumni as well as virtual events about careers in Computer Science. While it is not tailored specifically to Hawaii students, it could provide inspiration to students who want to attend college out of state. This way, they remember this institution because they found useful resources. 

## HackClub
HackClub is a virtual club that provides workshops and information on hackathons and creates a community atmosphere with its message boards. Local Hack clubs are run by students and they are the ones to lead the workshops, with materials provided by the Hack club organization. This framework puts more power in the hands of high school students and while it is a novel idea, it heavily relies on drive from the students themselves. It partially relies on the fact that these students are very interested in computer science and that they have had some exposure in the past. 

## Tableau Data KIds
This is a resource that helps students get exposure to data science. The graphics and overall visual theme of the website indicate it is aimed towards younger students in elementary or middle school. While it may not look coding heavy, the point of this resource seems to be exposure for data science in an accessible manner. However, this resource will need to be introduced to the students, maybe by an educator or by CSExplore.

## Other Thoughts
There are so many excellent free resources out there for students of all ages. But there is the problem of exposing these resources to students. Most students hear about these opportunities through school, facilitated by their teachers or extracurricular activities.
